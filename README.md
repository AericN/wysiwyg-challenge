# wysiwyg

This editor is a lightweight option for allowing simple text editing, saving of templates, creation and saving of dynamic variables, and auto-population of templates with those variables. The editor also displays the corresponding exported html so that templates can be copied and used outside the program.

This project was written using Vue.js, styled with Vuetify, and uses 'Tiptap' under the hood to power the editor and it's features. Basic testing via Vue Testing Library is also included.
